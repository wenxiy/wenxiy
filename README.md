## 👋 Hi there! I'm Xin Wen (温鑫)

🎓 I graduated from **Central China Normal University (CCNU)** with a Bachelor's degree in **Electronic Information Engineering**.  

🎓 I’m now a Master's student in **Software Engineering** at **The University of Queensland (UQ)**, Australia 🇦🇺.  

💼 I previously worked as an **Android Client Engineer Intern at Kuaishou (快手)**, and I’ve recently received an offer from **Tencent** for **C++ Client Development**.  

💻 I’m passionate about **Android development**, **concurrency & distributed systems**, **information retrieval (IR)**, and building practical systems—from mobile apps to intelligent retrieval pipelines.

### 🧠 What I'm Exploring

- 🔍 **Information Retrieval:** BM25, DPR, ANCE, ColBERT, SPLADE, TILDE  
- 🔄 **Concurrency & Distributed Systems:** monitors, locks (CLH/MCS), starvation-freedom proofs  
- 🤖 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** LLM-based re-ranking, hybrid retrieval  
- ☁️ **Cloud-native architecture:** AWS, Terraform  
- 📱 **High-performance Android engineering:** Jetpack Compose, UI architecture
